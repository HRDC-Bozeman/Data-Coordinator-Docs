# Homebuyer Education Online Registration

Online HBE registration combines Google Forms, Form Publisher, and Google Sheets to handle all the form generation and class management.

- Household applies through a Google Form
- Their responses to intake questions are rendered onto PDF templates to reproduce old paper intake materials
- Households that applied, when they applied, their contact info, and much more are displayed on a Google Sheets response dashboard.
