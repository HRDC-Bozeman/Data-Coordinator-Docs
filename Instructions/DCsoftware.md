# Data Coordinator Software Installation and Setup Guide

The purpose of this document is to outline the tools necessary to fulfill the role of Data Coordinator, how to install and configure them, and some basic usage.

# Python

Python is a programming language. The official Python tutorial can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/). The entire data coordinator code base is written using Python 3.6+. A series of Python commands can be written to a file with a `.py` file extension.

In order to use Python on your computer, it must be installed. I recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to manage the finer points of the installation. It is also possible to install Python directly, a download link can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Modules

Python allows you to import existing code modules. These modules are other applications written in Python that can be used to supplement your own code. For example, let's say you want to read the data from a .csv file. Vanilla Python theoretically has the tools needed to read that data, but the people who created the `pandas` package already figured out a quick and efficient way to handle that process. Here is a breakdown of the most commonly used modules in the code base





- SQL Server
- SQL Server Management Studio
- Visual Studio
- Sublime Text
- Markdown Monster
- Github Desktop
