# Program Attendance

The program attendance form allows users to add services for multiple clients on the same date. This functionality is currently used by Homemaker, Senior Reach, and Senior Groceries. Set the service date, quantity, program, and service type. Clients with open enrollments in the selected program will appear in the list. Check each client that received that service on that day.
